## Code Explanation

The app is primarily built with two components: `App` and `Task`. 

- `App` is the main component handling the logic for task creation, deletion, update, and filtering. It also saves the tasks in local storage to ensure data persistence.

- `Task` is a child component used to render individual tasks. It receives its props from the `App` component and also triggers the update and delete functionalities by invoking the corresponding functions passed down from the `App` component.

The styling of the app is managed via the `App.css` file. It follows a minimalistic soft UI approach with a lively color scheme centered around pink (#e26565).
